# Viant-s-Cultural-Reasoning-
Cultural Reasoning is the ability of a system (human or AI) to correctly interpret behavior, decisions, and risk within the cultural logic that produced them, rather than mislabeling culturally rational actions as errors, threats, or incompetence.
# Cultural Reasoning Standard

## Purpose

This project incorporates **Cultural Reasoning** as a foundational design principle.

Cultural Reasoning is the ability to correctly interpret behavior, decisions, and risk
within the cultural logic that produced them, rather than misclassifying culturally
rational actions as errors, threats, or incompetence.

Systems that lack Cultural Reasoning routinely fail under real-world conditions.

## Why Cultural Reasoning Is Necessary

Empirical evidence across finance, healthcare, criminal justice, employment, and AI
demonstrates a recurring failure pattern when the following conditions coexist:

1. Power asymmetry
2. Cultural framework mismatch
3. High-stakes outcomes
4. No mechanism for cultural interpretation

When these conditions are present, misclassification becomes predictable and systemic.

This is not a moral argument.
It is a systems reliability issue.

## What Cultural Reasoning Is (and Is Not)

### Cultural Reasoning IS:
- A corrective lens for interpreting intent vs outcome
- A method for identifying structural risk misclassification
- A safeguard against one-size-fits-all assumptions
- Compatible with accountability and standards

### Cultural Reasoning IS NOT:
- An excuse for harmful behavior
- Moral relativism
- A replacement for law or policy
- A denial of individual responsibility

---

## Core Principle

> Culturally rational behavior may appear irrational or risky when evaluated
> outside the cultural system that produced it.

Failure to account for this leads to:
- False risk signals
- Ineffective interventions
- Unintended harm
- Systemic instability

---

## Implementation Guidance

Projects adopting Cultural Reasoning should:

- Distinguish intent from outcome
- Separate cultural obligation from misconduct
- Avoid assuming a single normative baseline
- Surface uncertainty where cultural context is incomplete
- Prefer explanation over punishment when feasible

---

## Scope

Cultural Reasoning applies to:
- Human decision evaluation
- AI system outputs
- Policy design
- Risk assessment
- Narrative and character modeling

This standard is intentionally lightweight and non-prescriptive.
It is designed to integrate with existing ethical, legal, and technical frameworks.

## Attribution

Cultural Reasoning is part of the broader Vianté frameworks for
ethical system design, narrative integrity, and AI evaluation.
